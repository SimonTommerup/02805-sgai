Social Graphs and Interactions: Bipartite network exploration on reddit

## Introduction

### Building the network and node properties
Our idea is to take the top (maybe) 100 threads on two opposing subreddits, e.g. Biden and Trump. 
- Then for each thread, we will go over each comment to this thread by a user - these users will be nodes in a set U
- For each of these users, we will save two properties
    1. "trump_reddit" if comment was posted on a trump thread (i.e. on the trump reddit). Otherwise "bidden_reddit".
    2. "trump_supporter" if sentiment ("happyness") of comment is above some threshold. Otherwise "biden_supporter".
- For each user-node u in set U, we will go over other subreddits which they have also commented on and add this subreddit as a new reddit-node v which we gather in a set V. We then make a link from u to v.
- We should then be left with a bipartite network where users are linked to all the subreddits which they have ever commented. 
- Then, we can extract a complete user-network *user_net*, where two users $u_1$ and $u_2$ are linked with link l, if they both are linked to a reddit-node v for any v in V. The link l should have "subreddits" list as property, which contain all the subreddit which links the two users (e.g. if they both commented on 'USA' and 'ANIMALS' subreddits
### Analyze *user_net* network
We can then apply all tools learned in the course to this net.
- If we seperate nodes on either property 1 or 2 above - does their seem to be a community structure? From plots or modularity score? This would mean that e.g. "trump_supporter"s are more likely to be active on another subreddit like "corona virus doesn't exist" or similar...


### TODOs:
- Change encoding of list to json format (by calling json.dump(list))
- Make retrievel script robust to server errors etc. (know where to start script if it stops..)
- Downlaod data!!!


### Outline:

Klassificering og community detection:
Node attributes (hvordan klassificere vi users - negative kommentare eller bare parent reddit) - et klassificerings problem
tekstanalyse (sentiment analysis - til klassificering)
netværksanalyse (parent reddit)
frekvens af top-comments på parent reddit 
Community detection/score
Modularity score for trump vs biden partition for each classification
Brug TR term ratio to make word clouds!
“sub-word-clouds” for the most frequent words for the entire network (word clouds for comments der indeholder “covid” fx) 
Partition within each party (“sub-communities”)
Word clouds for each of these using TF-IDF
Network statistics to learn about them?
 
Simple network statistics and analysis:
Network type - random, scale-free etc. (node distribution)
edge properties for most connected nodes (where edge property between two nodes are their common other_subreddits)
top commented subreddits (within each community / overall)
average shortest path within communities (fortæller om diversiteten af vælgerne?)  
average degree within communities (fortæller noget om hvor mange fælles interesser de har)
Most central users with respect to degree centrality (disse users interesser dækker umiddelbart de mest typiske interesser for denne egenskab/subreddit - og dermed måske også trump/biden suportters?)
 
Natural language processing:
Lexical diversity within communities (Er et community mere velformuleret end det andet? - kig eventuelt også på kompleksitet af ord, såsom ordlængde)
Collocations (make america great again?)
Sentiment analysis
Hvilke brugere er typisk mest positive negative (eller hvilken side er mest positiv eller negativ stemt?)
Er der tendenser inden for sub-communities?
