Celsissima;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"‚ÄúIn Fairfax County, an early-morning math error led to over-reporting Biden‚Äôs lead by roughly 100,000 votes ‚Äî a mistake that Stephen M. Hunt, chairman of the Fairfax County electoral board, said was discovered and corrected within 10 to 15 minutes.

Hunt said approximately two-thirds of Fairfax County‚Äôs vote came through early absentee voting. An election worker initially erroneously added 100,000 to Biden‚Äôs absentee ballot count when adding up all the sources of absentee ballots in the county: by mail, through a dropbox, in person. The correct vote totals in Fairfax County as of 2:30 a.m. Wednesday showed Biden with roughly 404,000 votes to Trump‚Äôs roughly 162,000.‚Äù

jayembeisme;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"Do we have proof?  YES!  Just look at the wealth of information from the owner of the store where Biden dropped off the laptops to get them fixed!!

1) WHERE DID IT COME FROM? ‚Äúthe owner of the computer store, John Paul MacIsaac, was unable and unwilling to answer key questions about how the laptop supposedly arrived in his store, and eventually, how the data was shared with Giuliani‚Äù

2) DID HUNTER DROP THEM OFF HIMSELF? ‚ÄúMacIsaac admitted he was unable to confirm it was actually Hunter Biden who dropped off the laptop because he is ""legally blind""‚Äù

3) DID THE OWNER SECURE THE SENSITIVE CONTENTS? ‚ÄúMacIsaac refused to answer in any detail whether or why he would have searched through the laptop to find a four-year-old email, which seemingly appears to be an innocuous message about arranging a meeting for coffee.‚Äù

4) WHY ARE THE LIBS SCREAMIN‚Äô ‚ÄòBOUT RUDY G? ‚ÄúMacIsaac responded to most questions about Giuliani with ""no comment,"" saying he ""didn't feel comfortable"" discussing it. He declined to say whether he sought Giuliani out or vice versa, but he indicated he viewed the former New York mayor as a potential ally.‚Äù

5) THANK GOD THE OWNER IS OF SOUND MIND AND BODY AND NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORIST. ‚ÄúOver the course of the interview, MacIsaac said he felt his life and business were in danger by possessing this information, invoking debunked conspiracy theories of revenge, specifically mentioning false allegations that a Democratic National Committee staffer was murdered in 2016 to cover up his supposed involvement in leaking Democratic Party emails. The emails were in fact stolen by Russian intelligence operatives, and the conspiracy theory surrounding his death was boosted by a Russian disinformation campaign.‚Äù

Celsissima;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"‚ÄúIn Fairfax County, an early-morning math error led to over-reporting Biden‚Äôs lead by roughly 100,000 votes ‚Äî a mistake that Stephen M. Hunt, chairman of the Fairfax County electoral board, said was discovered and corrected within 10 to 15 minutes.

Hunt said approximately two-thirds of Fairfax County‚Äôs vote came through early absentee voting. An election worker initially erroneously added 100,000 to Biden‚Äôs absentee ballot count when adding up all the sources of absentee ballots in the county: by mail, through a dropbox, in person. The correct vote totals in Fairfax County as of 2:30 a.m. Wednesday showed Biden with roughly 404,000 votes to Trump‚Äôs roughly 162,000.‚Äù

jayembeisme;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"Do we have proof?  YES!  Just look at the wealth of information from the owner of the store where Biden dropped off the laptops to get them fixed!!

1) WHERE DID IT COME FROM? ‚Äúthe owner of the computer store, John Paul MacIsaac, was unable and unwilling to answer key questions about how the laptop supposedly arrived in his store, and eventually, how the data was shared with Giuliani‚Äù

2) DID HUNTER DROP THEM OFF HIMSELF? ‚ÄúMacIsaac admitted he was unable to confirm it was actually Hunter Biden who dropped off the laptop because he is ""legally blind""‚Äù

3) DID THE OWNER SECURE THE SENSITIVE CONTENTS? ‚ÄúMacIsaac refused to answer in any detail whether or why he would have searched through the laptop to find a four-year-old email, which seemingly appears to be an innocuous message about arranging a meeting for coffee.‚Äù

4) WHY ARE THE LIBS SCREAMIN‚Äô ‚ÄòBOUT RUDY G? ‚ÄúMacIsaac responded to most questions about Giuliani with ""no comment,"" saying he ""didn't feel comfortable"" discussing it. He declined to say whether he sought Giuliani out or vice versa, but he indicated he viewed the former New York mayor as a potential ally.‚Äù

5) THANK GOD THE OWNER IS OF SOUND MIND AND BODY AND NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORIST. ‚ÄúOver the course of the interview, MacIsaac said he felt his life and business were in danger by possessing this information, invoking debunked conspiracy theories of revenge, specifically mentioning false allegations that a Democratic National Committee staffer was murdered in 2016 to cover up his supposed involvement in leaking Democratic Party emails. The emails were in fact stolen by Russian intelligence operatives, and the conspiracy theory surrounding his death was boosted by a Russian disinformation campaign.‚Äù

LordSThor;President-elect Joe Biden;"First off if you haven't voted already, go FUCKING VOTE

Second off

This makes me happy :)

FYI the numbers are likely to improve over the next few days. 538 expected the polls to tighten as we approached election day, they have slightly (by like half a point) but Biden is still roughly ahead by 9 points, and ahead in pretty much every single swing state often times he's ahead by 5 points or more.

In fact if we had the election today and Biden only won states which he had a 5 point or greater lead he'd still have 290 EC Votes.

Trump needs about 7 or 8 point swing to win

That's not happening.

Basically everything we see indicates Trump is going lose in a landslide.";"[""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Reddit Sports"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""World News"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Relationship Advice"", ""Reddit Sports"", ""Politics"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""PC Gaming"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Politics"", ""best of reddit"", ""Politics"", ""World News"", ""Politics"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""/r/PublicFreakout"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Korea: Life, News, and Identity"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Georgia, USA"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""/r/buildapc - Planning on building a computer but need some advice?
