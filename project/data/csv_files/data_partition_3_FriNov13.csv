Rocco112263;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"Listen, the argument being made for the circumstances of an observer in Philly not being allowed in was one case I've seen video of. I dont have the source on hand, was just a guy with documents saying he could be there, and two people at the door not allowing it and telling him to call the police. 
  The argument against the observers that were testified as being there, was about like you said, for them to have a closer viewing to verify documents. The rules set in that station, as well as others but not all, were for them to read from a 6 foot distance. Which may not be impossible for everyone, but it sure as hell makes it difficult. They just wanted to verify the names but the Covid protocol said they had to be a certain distance. 
 Some stations received permission to get closer, as they were, the people handling the ballots repositioned their table further to have the 6 foot distance, defeating the purpose.

evenios;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"the title of this post is exactly the definition of Donald J Trump and all of his supporters.

Hypocracy

perhaps fitting that the top trending posts both have that in its title.

And yes thats the same song and dance christians have been touting for years better not blame us.  Muslims are evil.  Obama is a muslim so therefor he is a terrorist.  Trump is not about terror.   He would never support something like that.

Friday afternoon a flood of vehicals sorrounded Bidens bus screaming profantaties and insults at it.  They then pulled in front of the bus to try to slow it down in the middle of the highway.. a dangerous and potentally deadly act.   reports are the goal was they wanted to push the bus off the road... and one trump spporter posted on facebook that he rammed one of the biden vehicals

using violence and fear to intimidate people more so about a government even if actual violence does not take place but in this case engagine in a clearly illigal and dangerous act (blocking a vehcal in the middle of the highway)

&#x200B;

IS the very definition of domestic terrorism.

if it ended there... one could say it was just a isolated group of people that had nothing to personally do with  the President.

it didnt end there.

Trump not once, not twice, but at least three times personally indicated his support and encouragement of the events tweeting that they were :""patriots"": knowing FULL well at that time (and even tweeting about it ) that the FBI was investigating the incident.

Congratulations.  Your president who for so long tried to smear Obama as a terrorist. just publicaly supported domestic terrorism.

I guess when  his lies fail to convince people hes :""right:"" He turns to fear.

Hypocrisy indeed.

Oh and yes the Christians are blameless.  They didnt elect into power someone from day ONE who  was proven to be a immoral, bigoted,  hateful. womanizing bigot, not so much by what others said about him but what he said HIMSELF in his own words and his OWN  tweets.

over the last four years i have watched in horror as chruch after church and christian leader after christian leader bowed down at the altar  of the Cult of Trump, giving into his lies and his con game.....because they were too afraid to fight for what was right on their own.    Their were sooo afraid of Clinton.she was pro choice.. she was pro LGBT she would take away their religous freedom.

Religous freedom isnt the right to cram your one sided views down other peoples throats.  It is the right to worship as YOU choose.   You dont like abortions, dont have abortions..  You dont like gay marrage. dont marry your own sex.  simple as that.    Trying to cram that down the rest of americas throats and then justifying that by electing the most morally currupt and dangerous man in history (of us presidency) to power IS the definition of conspiracy.

but instead of teaching love and understanding which is what Jesus taught you use your faith as a weapon to bow beat the bible over peoples heads.    You demoize the democrats and others as evil and dark just to justify your warped views.  You use fox news as a platform for hate and ignorance so long as it suited you.

and want hypocracy?  You have an image We the people as a banner for this subreddit but when Trump loses the election you will do everything in your power to try to stop legitimate votes from counting and if that doesnt work you and Trump will turn to violence and more fear.

Hypocracy

you hate what you do not understand

you hate the democrats you hate the muslims you hate LGBT people (not all of you but many Trump supporters do)

but on the other hand God forbid anyone disagree with your views .

But you are all conned.  Trump doesnt care about you..he doesnt care about America he only cares about himself.  He is willing to tear this country apart and burn everything it stands for to the ground  so long as it suits his own ego and his own agenda.

you support a man who keeps saying he will get the virus under control. and has done anything but.    He even wants to fire the top guy who was the voice for decades in fighting not just this but other epidemics too.   What plan has Trump to stop the virus?

none

he has no plan.  There is no plan in place. there was never any plan in place

200 thousand people dead.  Nine million americans infected.  and all the president can do is spread lies and act like he could give a shit about the virus...holding massive unprotected rallys that are infecting thousands and killing at least 700 people as a direct result.

and literally leaving his supporters out in the cold as he boards his fancy plane after they are over while the rest of them are stuck out in the cold waiting for the buses.

the more Trump supporters shout Hypocrisy.  They more they are speaking about themselves.

hypocrisy indeed.

* Despite saying they had ""GREAT coffee,"" called a coffee shop ""totally depressing"" and rated them poorly because they pay employees minimum wage in addition to benefits (because ""they should get benefits anyway"").

LocallySourcedWeirdo;President-elect Joe Biden;"I ended up in the middle of one of these Texas MAGA parades last weekend as they drove toward a major Collin County polling place to intimidate voters. 

There was road construction, and my lane came to an abrupt end, and I needed to merge into the middle of the caravan of lifted Texas trash pickups flying Trump flags. I signaled, and one of the trucks covered in MAGA decorations made room for me to merge. So I drove for a couple of miles in the middle of the racist parade. I'm white and my car doesn't have any Democratic paraphernalia on it (for this very reason), so they didn't have reason to pick on me. If I had dark skin, or any liberal bumper stickers on my car, I'm not sure what they would have done. They were riled up, honking and yelling.

Trump doesn’t understand loving someone, and he’s ashamed of his own namesake who is just a completely tragic and pathetic guy.

Saltylaky;President-elect Joe Biden;Me too!

IrishGuyNYC00;President-elect Joe Biden;Trump and the GOP really are pathetic. I'm actually more ashamed of the GOP than Trump. Trump is a fool, he's a narcissist, we knew this was coming from Trump and expected it, but the GOP, they should know better. As if we needed reminding how spineless and callous they are. Just as pathetic as rushing through a Supreme Court nomination a week before an election they knew they were going to lose their mandate, so as not to have Trump in the same lame duck scenario as the Obama excuse they used to block his appointment, doing so instead of putting pandemic relief on the agenda for the millions of Americans that need it, they're now actively participating in the undermining of the most sacred fabric of American society, democracy, all to pander to a tyrant out of cowardice of retribution. I can't think of anything less patriotic.
