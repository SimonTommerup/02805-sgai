goobiyadi;President-elect Joe Biden;"How is religious freedom a reason to object to same-sex marriage?  Nobody is going up to random people and saying, ""You have to marry someone of the same gender.""  It's a CHOICE who you want to marry. If you don't want to get married, or if you want to marry a consenting adult who identifies as someone with a gender that's the same or different than yours, then go for it. Why does it matter who other people marry?

I will NEVER understand why people try to use their religious beliefs to justify their own extreme discomfort with anyone who is slightly different from them.

Sorry, I'll step off my soapbox now.

Kay312010;President-elect Joe Biden;"I saw a chart on TV a few weeks ago. It showed each decade and the progress this country made towards acceptance of the LGBT community. The acceptance went from the low 30% (early on) to 70% (this decade). When President Obama gave his speech today about progress on racial inequity, it made me think of the country’s progress as a whole. 

Even though some people didn’t agree with full LGBT and civil rights, they grew to admit their mistake and worked to change their view. I’m good with that. 

All people can do is admit mistakes and change. We have a president that won’t admit mistakes and change course. In fact, he doubles down on his bigoted, racist and sexist rhetoric with the policy agenda to match. That’s what makes a person bad for the country, not someone willing to change for the better.

Infinite_Warning;President-elect Joe Biden;"I’m completely ok with gay marriage. I’m also a former Christian, current agnostic. 

The pope agreeing with Civil unions for gay people just doesn’t gel with the Christian faith. While I don’t consider gay marriage to be wrong in anyway, the Bible does.

What the pope said today, is the same as if the pope said he was cool with adultery. It goes against what is stated in the Bible.

WindLane;President-elect Joe Biden;"This is asking for the rational Republicans to explain the actions of the irrational Republicans.

They aren't going to have an easier time figuring it out than we are.

The problem is that Trump emboldened the absolute worst people. Those people have gotten loud and belligerent with practically everything they do and they seem to feel that Trump was the best thing ever because he made it okay for them to be their horrible selves wherever they feel like.

Trump losing the election, takes all that away. So those obnoxious, ignorant pricks are going to be as loud and as obnoxious as they can on their way out in the hopes that throwing a temper tantrum will change the results.

At their core, they are ignorant. The House and the Senate didn't change all that much and none of those folks are backing idiots like the Proud Boys openly like Trump is. They've got no reason to *care* about the House and the Senate - so they don't care about those votes and just give their ignorant, ""yeah, that vote was fair.""

Republicans probably couldn't tell you this because they're too close to the problem, don't want to make their party look even worse, or are too ashamed of their fellow party members to speak out against them - with a heavy dose of not wanting to be tarred with the same brush.";"[""All news, US and international."", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""White People Twitter"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""All news, US and international."", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""PhotoshopBattles"", ""All things Trashy!"", ""Future(s) Studies"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""The Best and Worst of TikTok"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""Today I Learned (TIL)"", ""NBA"", ""Prompts and motivation to create something out of nothing"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""MovieDetails"", ""World News"", ""NBA"", ""Accidental Racism: When innocent things appear to be racism, though it's totally not intentional "", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA"", ""NBA""]";

Clinton appointed a Republican to be defense secretary.  I'll give Bush some credit, he appointed a democrat to be secretary of transportation (this is more than offset by the purge at the justice department, and it's a less important post than defense but okay, at least there was reciprocity).  Obama appointed three.  It was not only a reciprocal gesture, but an expansion of it.  It was a very ambitious good faith gesture that cost him with his own party.  But it was not met in kind by Republicans in Congress, and Trump of course did nothing to keep such attempts at bipartisanship.

I beg you, when you cast your next primary vote for house, senate and the presidency, you vote for someone who will work *with* Democrats.

But as his reaction and response to corona has shown he doesn't care about American lives. You support that.  so thanks but no thanks friendo.  This country is about to experience one of it's darkest periods and supporters of trump, like you, are going to be the cause.

And the worst thing is he planned this upcoming carnage, knowing he would probably lose he planted the seeds by calling mail in votes fraudulent for months before the election knowing that democrats were being encouraged to vote by mail.  his plan to sabotage the USPS failed so now we're in phase 2...  phase 3, after he loses in court, is when it gets nasty.

Trump supporters, like you, are at fault.  So no thanks, go back to  your side and know this, if we fall it's because your man would rather burn it all down than to lose power.

JournalofFailure;President-elect Joe Biden;"Here’s my thinking about Trump supporters: if you’re still out there screaming about election fraud, marching through the streets while visibly armed, have QAnon stickers all over your car and have ever used the phrase “fuck your feelings” unironically, go away and don’t come back until you’ve legitimately repented.

Special-Bite;President-elect Joe Biden;"Good on you for trying to heal heal the division.

There's a few things to establish before we can come together on healing. Science is real, the warming earth is ACTUALLY happening. The stock market doesn't matter for regular folks, a steady paycheck does. Barack Obama is United States citizen. Osama Bin Laden is actually dead. There is no massive voter fraud operation happening. Chem trails are a made up load of bullshit. Refugees just want to come to a better place, they aren't terrorists. Vaccines don't cause autism and the flu shot doesn't infect you with the flu. Windmills don't cause cancer or kill all the birds. Hillary Clinton's emails are unequivocally irrelevant. The Confederacy was a group of traitors to the United States of America. Inherent racism still exists in today's society and is an existential threat to black people.

Once republicans can recognize those basic things, then we can being to start healing. If we can't agree on basic common facts the you all can fuck right off thank you.";"[""/r/Technology "", ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare | Reddit"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""World News"", ""Reddit Science"", ""/r/Music"", ""President-elect Joe Biden"", ""Where hockey players come to share tips, advice, highlights or just to rant"", ""Call of Duty: Warzone | Reddit"", ""hockey: the best game on earth.

JTRigz;President-elect Joe Biden;"I wish most Trump supporters shared this sentiment, I really, really do. But, the truth is they are far from. Something unforgivable is this wedge that’s been jammed into families due to Trumpism and Fox News. The truth about Trumps base is most aren’t Republicans, they’re Trump supporters period. Personally, these last four years have done more damage to my family than anything I could imagine. It’s sad, it hurts, and I just hope, god willing, it can be repaired. 

My wife and I were ecstatic when the announcement finally came in. I think the combination of these last few years, 2020 in general, and then the days waiting for the declaration made her rush to post a simple “yay Biden” or something on Facebook. From then on she’s been getting eviscerated by some family. I wouldn’t say she’s super political by any means, most people aren’t, but she was just happy. Nobody has come to her defense and the Trumpers are just ridiculous. I’ve come very close to creating a Facebook just to tell them to back off.
