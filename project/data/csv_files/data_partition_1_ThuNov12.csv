Now I vote blue. I’m not fond of their policies but my options are to vote for the candidate that urges white supremacists (and those that enable him) in and the one that does not do that.

More people turned out for Trump this year than last time. More turned out for Trump than, Romney or McCain. More turned out for Trump than won Bush either of his presidencies. Not by a small amount either, by Millions (almost 20 million in Bush's case).

I am sorry, Trump isn't some aberration. He is exactly what the Republican voter want. That is why they broke records to vote for him.

If that isn't what YOU are about, then your not a Republican anymore. They threw you out.

iamawesomesaurus;President-elect Joe Biden;For me this election wasn't about policies, it was about character. Only one candidate has the character and decency that this country needs. Only one candidate has the respect for our country. I may not agree with everything the democrats want, but I do want a leader who cares about Americans and democracy and our country. Hopefully the conservatives find their spines and get out of the gutter for the next election.;"[""MadeMeSmile"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""funny"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""KotakuInAction: The almost-official GamerGate subreddit!"", ""Android"", ""COMIC SANS GALORE"", ""COMIC SANS GALORE"", "".gifs - funny, animated gifs for your viewing pleasure"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Advice Animals"", ""True stories that are $100% true and actually happened."", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""cracker bargel"", ""TumblrInAction: O Toucan, Where Art Thou?"", ""True stories that are $100% true and actually happened."", ""Rick and Morty News and Discussion"", ""Sacramento Local News and Forum"", ""Pok\u00e9mon GO's Largest Grassroots Network: The Silph Road"", ""It's Arrested Development."", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Today I Fucked Up"", ""disprove that Reddit's New Look causes skin cancer"", ""Advice Animals"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Pok\u00e9mon GO - Discover Pok\u00e9mon in the Real World!"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""TalesFromRetail"", ""Beermoney: Make money online"", ""Today I Learned (TIL)"", ""Safety First!"", ""motorcycles"", ""Uplifting News"", ""Buy low, sell high"", ""/r/Memes the original since 2008"", ""Where everyone is a quantum scientist..."", ""Incels In Action - people mad they ain't getting any action"", ""Sacramento Local News and Forum"", ""SluttyConfessions"", ""California Guns"", ""Sacramento Local News and Forum"", ""It's Arrested Development."", ""For photos that are, you know, mildly interesting"", ""For the identification of mysterious objects"", ""It's Arrested Development."", ""Just Rolled Into the Shop"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""#madebygoogle"", ""Android""]";

KR1735;President-elect Joe Biden;"The fact that this was even remotely close in the electoral college is an indictment of our system. The headline in every newspaper needs to be “Joe Biden wins largest popular mandate since 1932.”

And the fact that Republicans are trying to make this appear close with their theatrics is laughable.

EDIT: Since this comment seems to have blown up, I should point out that it was made in the context of the original post. Yes, I know there were times when winners got more of the vote. But not challengers. This is a popular rebuke of the Trump administration. It's a signal that Americans want the country to go in a different direction than that to where the incumbent is taking us. And, in that sense, it's a huge mandate -- the biggest since 1932, a year that Americans were pissed over the Depression. Biden needs to advocate for wholesale reforms like FDR did. McConnell can piss and moan (assuming he's still majority leader), but Biden needs to be clear about what he intends to do...even if that ends up getting watered down.";"[""Today I Learned (TIL)"", ""Murdered By Words"", ""Murdered By Words"", ""Today I Learned (TIL)"", ""Like when the food hella good, you say bone apple tea, it's like french or some shit."", ""Relationship Advice"", ""President-elect Joe Biden"", ""/r/PublicFreakout"", ""Vexillology: for all you flag lovers out there!"", ""Murdered By Words"", ""For your Opinions that are Unpopular "", ""Relationship Advice"", ""Am I the Asshole?
