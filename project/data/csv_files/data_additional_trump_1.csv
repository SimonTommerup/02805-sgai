In the early 2000s they won the pulitzer prize for their investigative journalism into what is now reffered to as ""CoinGate,"" which was essentially an criminal enterprise closely tied to the REPUBLICAN party. In which a certain faction decided to defraud the Bureau of Workers Compensation. (Swell guys)

But have since been bought by an abusive drunken asshole. Changed ownership to a man who's uber-rich family has great stakes in the telecom realms.

So it's absolutely no surprise to me that they've decided to back the president.

He asked her a simple question about it, she dismissed it implying Trump's gaffes are worse, and he let her get away with it. Just like that. Granted, not much more could've been expected from Tapper, but it'd have been great to see him continue his line of questioning.

They know Biden's toast but doesn't have the brain cells to realize it so they're trying to protect him. It's sad and pathetic.
