bullfrog7777;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"I had a boss once that was tactless and critical of everyone, including me. It impacted the work environment and drove me nuts because I couldn’t fathom how such a person could keep their job while behaving this way.

It didn’t dawn on me until I spoke to a higher up about it that this person was hired to do exactly that. They needed at least one person to play “the bulldog” for the company and my boss was that person.

I wouldn’t have a beer with them but they added value in a way that was needed at that time.

1newworldorder;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"Yes. This is what i personally love about trump. He comes in swinging and isnt afraid to throw a jab uppercut combo...as the sharpie says, some times he follows through too much and punches a baby.

But whatever...im tired of the radical lefts insanity. They dont even care about the baby to begin with. Ive always been a republican but i havent really been impressed with any of the republican candidates for my entire life.

I want a republican who punches back and trump gives me exactly that. Its going to be hard after his presidency to find a candidate of his caliber that isnt afraid to get down and dirty...please god no more mitt romneys and john mccains and george bushes. Please.

He-is;President-elect Joe Biden;"Some people asked me about what made me change my mind about Trump so here it is. I care a lot about the troops and the foreign policy and Trump failed both. 

First [he withdrew from northern Syria ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-betrayed-us-fleeing-kurds-condemn-u-s-decision-to-leave-syria)and let Turkey invade and bomb the Kurds. 

Then COVID hit and Trump sent the national guard to help fight covid which is good. BUT [he called off the troops on the 89th day](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/05/20/early-end-date-for-guard-coronavirus-deployment-draws-criticism-from-veterans-in-congress/) of their deployment which would be one day before they would start getting retirement and education benefits. 

Shortly after that, the protests started and Trump called on the governors to call in the national guards and “dominate the streets.” 

Then there were reports that Russia put bounties on our troops and Trump knew about this for months and did nothing.

And most recently there were reports that [Trump called our troops “losers.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-said-us-soldiers-injured-and-killed-in-war-were-losers-magazine-reports/2020/09/03/6e1725cc-ee35-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html)

You know what's kind of amazing to me, on a personal level?  My family is about 50/50 Republican/Democrat.

spaghettieggrolls;President-elect Joe Biden;He's trying to twist this into a conspiracy theory against him because he knows his brain dead supporters who live in an echo chamber of Fox News and QAnon Facebook groups will take the bait.

There is no place deep enough in hell for trump.  I don't know how we are supposed to unite as a country when trumpers wont even offer a finger of compromise, its disguting.

a13wa;President-elect Joe Biden;"As an Indian immigrant with an Indian wife, I am breathing a sigh of relief.
I came here to get an education and never left. I came to the US in 2007 and right after Obama, things felt so much better.
In the US, I found a place to where I belonged. Growing up in India, I never had that feeling.

Trump came in 2016 and I lived on edge ever since. 

Everytime I went back to see my mom, I will be worried about going through the visa interview process. Granted DHS were never too welcoming, but I didn't feel a sense of hostility from them, until 2016. I made a point to enter the US either from NYC or SFO, as I might get agents who have lived amongst brown people and might be a little more human towards us.

On Saturday, We were so happy and felt the joy that I first felt when I landed at ORD from New Delhi, many years ago.";"[""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""President-elect Joe Biden"", ""President-elect Joe Biden"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Kik for sissies!"", ""Those who can't get enough of wearing extremely feminine dresses"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Minnesota, United States (MN) - the front page of Minnesota"", ""Bisnapchat"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""DirtySnapchat "", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum"", ""Get a new grip on life - NF's official Reddit-hosted forum""]";

Biden is up by \~5 points, but that is still within standard margin of error (3.5 for each candidate, so a 7 point swing).

AnswerIsItDepends;President-elect Joe Biden;"Thank you.

I have a question though.  This relates to the famous quote ""what is in a name?""  from Shakespeare.  Why would you say you will always be a Republican?  I am assuming you chose to be Republican at some point for reasons.  What if the current Republicans did not match those reasons at all?

Don't get me wrong, I ***really*** hope the true, honest conservatives can reclaim the party.  I really do.  But I do not know enough about politics to give you odds on that.  What if they can't?  What if dishonest people steal the name ""Republican""?   I ask because, while I don't know the odds, I can't help but think the odds might be better if they knew they could lose support.

Full disclosure:  From 1987 to 2016 I was unaffiliated voter so party loyalty isn't natural for me.  So perhaps that is what I am struggling to understand.";"[""Am I the Asshole?
