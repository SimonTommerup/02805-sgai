Crowcorrector;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"Remember the piss dossier, that unverifiably claimed that Trump was pissed on by Russian hooker?  All over the media.

Evidence relating to crack-smoking, kid-fucking (potentially), back-door corrupt deals involving Hunter and Joe form an actual, physical laptop that can be checked out..... The media claims it's ""UnVeRiFiAbLe"" and supresses all related news, including banning a social media account of one of the oldest news organisations in the US (NY Post) for breaking the story.

Trump in office has literally been a turning point in history where the media (and alot of Democrats) were unmasked for the corrupt, machiavellian and evil forces that they are... and now the masses who are willing to look can see them for what they are.

I'd like to say yes, but that would probably be a lie on my part. Will we finally stand up when they take our AR15's? Probably not, we will rationalize, and say ""that's only 1 type of gun"". I'm not ready to die for one gun, that will make me look crazy. 

Maybe when they come for all guns after promising to only take ARs away? Nope, not then, all we have are pistols, shotguns, and hunting rifles. We forgot that we needed the AR to even stand a small chance. 
At that point they can do whatever they want with us. It's too late.

Liberty isn't stolen all at once, it's taken one issue at a time. They do it slowly over years so that most people rationalize the concessions. It's a stolen election here, or a rifle there.

NEVERCHEATED_;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;Republicans are on track to flip 13 house seats. Democrats are on track to flip 3. All in Georgia and North Carolina, not crazy flips, but extremely odd how it happens in these swing states. Also, if Trump is looking for foul play in PA, I don’t think it’s in Philadelphia(maybe some). But the only county in the entire state to have a lower percentage of Trump votes than percentage of registered Republicans is Delaware county. I live there and there is no way Trump did not get a large showing of voters for him on Election Day. There were lines at almost every polling place all day. If you compare this county and other Philly suburbs to any other non-swing-state suburb county, it’s is extremely out of place and irregular. You just can’t ignore the irregularity of trends in democrat controlled areas of swing states compared to the comparable trends in any other state.;"[""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""Conservative"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""Conservative"", ""A sub for Historymemes"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""History"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""Conservative"", ""conspiracy"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""A sub for Historymemes"", ""President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!"", ""A sub for Historymemes"", ""conspiracy"", ""President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!"", ""President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!"", ""WalkAway"", ""Christianity"", ""A sub for Historymemes"", ""conspiracy"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""A sub for Historymemes"", ""A sub for Historymemes"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""conspiracy"", ""Christianity"", ""conspiracy"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Christianity"", ""President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps"", ""Conservative"", ""Conservative"", ""Map Porn, for interesting maps""]";

DerangedDeceiver;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"You know what? I'm in a good mood today. I'll bite.

----------

The archetypical example of unprotected speech is ""Yelling 'FIRE!' in a crowded theater"". This speech is unprotected because it is *disinformation that may directly lead to other people taking action that causes people to be injured or even killed*. The person shouting ""FIRE!"" may be doing nothing more than speaking, they may not be participating in the ensuing evacuation, they may not even be lying (it may be that they honestly believe that the theater is on fire). However, due to the harmful effect their words may have on others, this speech is prohibited.

Now let's go over a simple example of how this kind of speech may show up in another form.

Lets posit a person who says, ""The reptilians have secretly taken over the US Postal Service and they are going to attack the country with chemical weapons if we don't stop them"". Now, we live in a time where any nutjob can upload their delusional conspiracy rant onto youtube and gain a following of people who sincerely believe them. It's a very real possibility that their words may inspire one of their viewers to attack the ""reptilians in disguise"" at the post office. That means that this statement is *disinformation that may directly lead to other people taking action that causes people to be injured or even killed*. I ask you: Does this example differ fundamentally from the former? Is this not another scenario where the best option is to stop the spread of this misinformation before someone gets injured or killed because of it?

Finally, lets go over a direct example. A statement in the same form as the previous example, but that isn't something silly I made up.

Lets posit a person who says, ""The muslims are invading America and trying to take over the government so they can force us to follow Sharia law"". This is a sentiment expressed so often, by so many people, that I wouldn't be surprised at all if somebody has actually said the exact words I just typed. It is a sentiment that has, factually, led to individuals taking what they are convinced is necessary action. Although it did not happen in America, the Christchurch shooting is an example that immediately comes to mind of someone being so convinced by the rhetoric of Muslims having some nefarious goal in practicing their religion and/or immigrating to the west that they commit a brutal act of mass murder against innocent people. This is, once again, *disinformation that may directly lead to other people taking action that causes people to be injured or even killed*. As such, I'll ask once more: Does this example differ fundamentally from the others? Is this not another scenario where the best option is to stop the spread of this misinformation before *more people* get injured or killed because of it?

----------

In all honesty, I don't believe I'll convince anybody with this, but I hope that, at the very least, it gives some of you a better idea of how some people come to disagree with you on the subject of silencing certain statements. 

Additionally, just a note, we all know that political discussion can get *exhausting*, so please understand that I may not reply to replies on this comment. I'm just not always up to it.

I don't... understand the logic here? I mean it sounds like it should make sense so I understand why you like it as a point, but when you think about it this is sort of nonsensical.

flexican_american;President Donald Trump - Trump 2020! - Election Defense Task Force - Stop The Steal!;"Leftist Agree! :D We do have a homeless problem! Let's tax the billionaires of Silicon Valley and their high ranking employees that want to gentrify our ""trendy"" urban neighborhoods we've been living in for generations. Let's reduce taxes on the working class and audit agencies to cut overhead. Also let's cut military spending because blowing up civilians just creates resent for our country and it's a waste of our tax money. These straw man arguments that the true left loves high income taxes on the working class is an argument in bad faith. The platform is: workers should own the means of production. The conservative welders and steel workers of my apartment building live in two bedroom units with 3 kids give or take. They should be able to afford a home for their family as they have made millions for their respective companies. Their labor is worth more than the money reflected on their paychecks. Same thing goes for retail workers. America is the people not a flag. The homeless people of california are in large part victims of the opioid epidemic.

* Greg Abbott pandering to the far right and enforcing voter suppression methods

* Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers growing their influence within the party decision makers

* Shelley 'UberKaren' Luther running for a State Senate seat only because she reopened her nail salon and got arrested for breaking the law

* Colloidal silver hawker Steve Hotze demanding that all rioters and protestors be shot and killed on sight

* Attorney General Ken Paxton finally being exposed for the fraudster piece of shit we always knew he is

* Lt. Governor Dan Patrick existing

* Ag Commissioner Sid Miller flying to Oklahoma on taxpayer funds to get a 'Jesus shot' 

* Every single GOP congressman, state house rep and state senator denying the climate change and stuffing every regulatory post with bureaucratic dismantlers

* Baptist churches hawking Christian Dominionist theory and pushing their Deacons and biggest tithers to run for office and literally instill a God King

* Ignoring the very principles that Republicans once stood for - limited government, low taxation, free trade and balanced budgets

* Mismanaging a COVID-19 pandemic so badly that the oil & gas industry (which I work in) is in complete tatters. Trump & Abbott ironically instilled a more effective fracking ban than anyone could ever hope for. Nice job looking out for the industry you supposedly support, dipshits (Biden helped lift the crude export ban in a - dare I say it - compromise, which was a huge boon for our industry and helped push Saudi Arabian crude oil back to their shores in lieu of American crude)

Not_Frank;President-elect Joe Biden;That’s Georgia for ya. My sister who has very serious medical conditions and can’t be out and about during the pandemic never received her absentee ballot. She inquired as to why and how to go about getting one sent to her ASAP and they basically said “we don’t know and there’s nothing we can do”. So she has to either not vote or find a basically empty polling place in order for her to vote without literally risking her life to do so.

**EDIT: Since this shot up, I'll take the time to implore you to volunteer because a few 100 more voters in the 6 key swing states is 0.01% of the margin which is recorded in history books, and is an amazing effort of helping prevent 4 more years of Trump.**

* [For a very in depth breakdown of the status of each swing state, please see a thread I made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/ic4xgq/a_very_detailed_review_of_each_swing_state_with/)  I'll link the images from it here for the lazy.
