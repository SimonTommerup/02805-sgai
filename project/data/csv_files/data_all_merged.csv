Now I vote blue. I’m not fond of their policies but my options are to vote for the candidate that urges white supremacists (and those that enable him) in and the one that does not do that.

More people turned out for Trump this year than last time. More turned out for Trump than, Romney or McCain. More turned out for Trump than won Bush either of his presidencies. Not by a small amount either, by Millions (almost 20 million in Bush's case).

I am sorry, Trump isn't some aberration. He is exactly what the Republican voter want. That is why they broke records to vote for him.

If that isn't what YOU are about, then your not a Republican anymore. They threw you out.

KR1735;biden;"The fact that this was even remotely close in the electoral college is an indictment of our system. The headline in every newspaper needs to be “Joe Biden wins largest popular mandate since 1932.”

And the fact that Republicans are trying to make this appear close with their theatrics is laughable.

EDIT: Since this comment seems to have blown up, I should point out that it was made in the context of the original post. Yes, I know there were times when winners got more of the vote. But not challengers. This is a popular rebuke of the Trump administration. It's a signal that Americans want the country to go in a different direction than that to where the incumbent is taking us. And, in that sense, it's a huge mandate -- the biggest since 1932, a year that Americans were pissed over the Depression. Biden needs to advocate for wholesale reforms like FDR did. McConnell can piss and moan (assuming he's still majority leader), but Biden needs to be clear about what he intends to do...even if that ends up getting watered down.";"[""Today I Learned (TIL)"", ""Murdered By Words"", ""Murdered By Words"", ""Today I Learned (TIL)"", ""Like when the food hella good, you say bone apple tea, it's like french or some shit."", ""Relationship Advice"", ""biden"", ""/r/PublicFreakout"", ""Vexillology: for all you flag lovers out there!"", ""Murdered By Words"", ""For your Opinions that are Unpopular "", ""Relationship Advice"", ""Am I the Asshole?

goobiyadi;biden;"How is religious freedom a reason to object to same-sex marriage?  Nobody is going up to random people and saying, ""You have to marry someone of the same gender.""  It's a CHOICE who you want to marry. If you don't want to get married, or if you want to marry a consenting adult who identifies as someone with a gender that's the same or different than yours, then go for it. Why does it matter who other people marry?

I will NEVER understand why people try to use their religious beliefs to justify their own extreme discomfort with anyone who is slightly different from them.

Kay312010;biden;"I saw a chart on TV a few weeks ago. It showed each decade and the progress this country made towards acceptance of the LGBT community. The acceptance went from the low 30% (early on) to 70% (this decade). When President Obama gave his speech today about progress on racial inequity, it made me think of the country’s progress as a whole. 

Even though some people didn’t agree with full LGBT and civil rights, they grew to admit their mistake and worked to change their view. I’m good with that. 

All people can do is admit mistakes and change. We have a president that won’t admit mistakes and change course. In fact, he doubles down on his bigoted, racist and sexist rhetoric with the policy agenda to match. That’s what makes a person bad for the country, not someone willing to change for the better. It’s true when they say some people hold others to a standard they can’t obtain themselves.";"[""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""North Carolina"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""Political Discussion"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""Restore Sanity in Politics!"", ""South Carolina News and Discussion"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""Political Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""biden"", ""Politics"", ""biden"", ""Vote Blue - Vote for Democrats!"", ""biden"", ""biden"", ""biden"", ""biden""]";

The problem is that Trump emboldened the absolute worst people. Those people have gotten loud and belligerent with practically everything they do and they seem to feel that Trump was the best thing ever because he made it okay for them to be their horrible selves wherever they feel like.

Trump losing the election, takes all that away. So those obnoxious, ignorant pricks are going to be as loud and as obnoxious as they can on their way out in the hopes that throwing a temper tantrum will change the results.

At their core, they are ignorant. The House and the Senate didn't change all that much and none of those folks are backing idiots like the Proud Boys openly like Trump is. They've got no reason to *care* about the House and the Senate - so they don't care about those votes and just give their ignorant, ""yeah, that vote was fair.""

I'll give Bush some credit, he appointed a democrat to be secretary of transportation (this is more than offset by the purge at the justice department, and it's a less important post than defense but okay, at least there was reciprocity).  Obama appointed three.  It was not only a reciprocal gesture, but an expansion of it.  It was a very ambitious good faith gesture that cost him with his own party.  But it was not met in kind by Republicans in Congress, and Trump of course did nothing to keep such attempts at bipartisanship.

I beg you, when you cast your next primary vote for house, senate and the presidency, you vote for someone who will work *with* Democrats.

This country is about to experience one of it's darkest periods and supporters of trump, like you, are going to be the cause.

And the worst thing is he planned this upcoming carnage, knowing he would probably lose he planted the seeds by calling mail in votes fraudulent for months before the election knowing that democrats were being encouraged to vote by mail.  his plan to sabotage the USPS failed so now we're in phase 2...  phase 3, after he loses in court, is when it gets nasty.

Trump supporters, like you, are at fault.  So no thanks, go back to  your side and know this, if we fall it's because your man would rather burn it all down than to lose power.

Special-Bite;biden;"Good on you for trying to heal heal the division.

There's a few things to establish before we can come together on healing. Science is real, the warming earth is ACTUALLY happening. The stock market doesn't matter for regular folks, a steady paycheck does. Barack Obama is United States citizen. Osama Bin Laden is actually dead. There is no massive voter fraud operation happening. Chem trails are a made up load of bullshit. Refugees just want to come to a better place, they aren't terrorists. Vaccines don't cause autism and the flu shot doesn't infect you with the flu. Windmills don't cause cancer or kill all the birds. Hillary Clinton's emails are unequivocally irrelevant. The Confederacy was a group of traitors to the United States of America. Inherent racism still exists in today's society and is an existential threat to black people.

Once republicans can recognize those basic things, then we can being to start healing.

JTRigz;biden;"I wish most Trump supporters shared this sentiment, I really, really do. But, the truth is they are far from. Something unforgivable is this wedge that’s been jammed into families due to Trumpism and Fox News. The truth about Trumps base is most aren’t Republicans, they’re Trump supporters period. Personally, these last four years have done more damage to my family than anything I could imagine. It’s sad, it hurts, and I just hope, god willing, it can be repaired. 

My wife and I were ecstatic when the announcement finally came in. I think the combination of these last few years, 2020 in general, and then the days waiting for the declaration made her rush to post a simple “yay Biden” or something on Facebook. From then on she’s been getting eviscerated by some family. I wouldn’t say she’s super political by any means, most people aren’t, but she was just happy. Nobody has come to her defense and the Trumpers are just ridiculous. I’ve come very close to creating a Facebook just to tell them to back off.

I dont have the source on hand, was just a guy with documents saying he could be there, and two people at the door not allowing it and telling him to call the police. 
  The argument against the observers that were testified as being there, was about like you said, for them to have a closer viewing to verify documents. The rules set in that station, as well as others but not all, were for them to read from a 6 foot distance. Which may not be impossible for everyone, but it sure as hell makes it difficult. They just wanted to verify the names but the Covid protocol said they had to be a certain distance. 
 Some stations received permission to get closer, as they were, the people handling the ballots repositioned their table further to have the 6 foot distance, defeating the purpose.

evenios;trump;"the title of this post is exactly the definition of Donald J Trump and all of his supporters.

Hypocracy

perhaps fitting that the top trending posts both have that in its title.

And yes thats the same song and dance christians have been touting for years better not blame us.  Muslims are evil.  Obama is a muslim so therefor he is a terrorist.  Trump is not about terror.   He would never support something like that.

Friday afternoon a flood of vehicals sorrounded Bidens bus screaming profantaties and insults at it.  They then pulled in front of the bus to try to slow it down in the middle of the highway.. a dangerous and potentally deadly act.   reports are the goal was they wanted to push the bus off the road... and one trump spporter posted on facebook that he rammed one of the biden vehicals

using violence and fear to intimidate people more so about a government even if actual violence does not take place but in this case engagine in a clearly illigal and dangerous act (blocking a vehcal in the middle of the highway)

&#x200B;

IS the very definition of domestic terrorism.

if it ended there... one could say it was just a isolated group of people that had nothing to personally do with  the President.

it didnt end there.

Trump not once, not twice, but at least three times personally indicated his support and encouragement of the events tweeting that they were :""patriots"": knowing FULL well at that time (and even tweeting about it ) that the FBI was investigating the incident.

Congratulations.  Your president who for so long tried to smear Obama as a terrorist. just publicaly supported domestic terrorism.

I guess when  his lies fail to convince people hes :""right:"" He turns to fear.

Hypocrisy indeed.

Oh and yes the Christians are blameless.  They didnt elect into power someone from day ONE who  was proven to be a immoral, bigoted,  hateful. womanizing bigot, not so much by what others said about him but what he said HIMSELF in his own words and his OWN  tweets.

over the last four years i have watched in horror as chruch after church and christian leader after christian leader bowed down at the altar  of the Cult of Trump, giving into his lies and his con game.....because they were too afraid to fight for what was right on their own.    Their were sooo afraid of Clinton.she was pro choice.. she was pro LGBT she would take away their religous freedom.

Religous freedom isnt the right to cram your one sided views down other peoples throats.  It is the right to worship as YOU choose.   You dont like abortions, dont have abortions..  You dont like gay marrage. dont marry your own sex.  simple as that.    Trying to cram that down the rest of americas throats and then justifying that by electing the most morally currupt and dangerous man in history (of us presidency) to power IS the definition of conspiracy.

but instead of teaching love and understanding which is what Jesus taught you use your faith as a weapon to bow beat the bible over peoples heads.    You demoize the democrats and others as evil and dark just to justify your warped views.  You use fox news as a platform for hate and ignorance so long as it suited you.

and want hypocracy?  You have an image We the people as a banner for this subreddit but when Trump loses the election you will do everything in your power to try to stop legitimate votes from counting and if that doesnt work you and Trump will turn to violence and more fear.

Hypocracy

you hate what you do not understand

you hate the democrats you hate the muslims you hate LGBT people (not all of you but many Trump supporters do)

but on the other hand God forbid anyone disagree with your views .

But you are all conned.  Trump doesnt care about you..he doesnt care about America he only cares about himself.  He is willing to tear this country apart and burn everything it stands for to the ground  so long as it suits his own ego and his own agenda.

you support a man who keeps saying he will get the virus under control. and has done anything but.    He even wants to fire the top guy who was the voice for decades in fighting not just this but other epidemics too.   What plan has Trump to stop the virus?

none

he has no plan.  There is no plan in place. there was never any plan in place

200 thousand people dead.  Nine million americans infected.  and all the president can do is spread lies and act like he could give a shit about the virus...holding massive unprotected rallys that are infecting thousands and killing at least 700 people as a direct result.

and literally leaving his supporters out in the cold as he boards his fancy plane after they are over while the rest of them are stuck out in the cold waiting for the buses.

the more Trump supporters shout Hypocrisy.  They more they are speaking about themselves.

hypocrisy indeed.

Basically, if you review them poorly you will receive hate notes, from the owner and friends. I did love the food.

I cannot support a business that contributes to the Trump campaign. A sad goodbye. If you need an alternative, Mint Indian Bistro has amazing food, service, and even a buffet sometimes.

LocallySourcedWeirdo;biden;"I ended up in the middle of one of these Texas MAGA parades last weekend as they drove toward a major Collin County polling place to intimidate voters. 

There was road construction, and my lane came to an abrupt end, and I needed to merge into the middle of the caravan of lifted Texas trash pickups flying Trump flags. I signaled, and one of the trucks covered in MAGA decorations made room for me to merge. So I drove for a couple of miles in the middle of the racist parade. I'm white and my car doesn't have any Democratic paraphernalia on it (for this very reason), so they didn't have reason to pick on me. If I had dark skin, or any liberal bumper stickers on my car, I'm not sure what they would have done. They were riled up, honking and yelling.

Trump doesn’t understand loving someone, and he’s ashamed of his own namesake who is just a completely tragic and pathetic guy.

Just as pathetic as rushing through a Supreme Court nomination a week before an election they knew they were going to lose their mandate, so as not to have Trump in the same lame duck scenario as the Obama excuse they used to block his appointment, doing so instead of putting pandemic relief on the agenda for the millions of Americans that need it, they're now actively participating in the undermining of the most sacred fabric of American society, democracy, all to pander to a tyrant out of cowardice of retribution.

NEVERCHEATED_;trump;Republicans are on track to flip 13 house seats. Democrats are on track to flip 3. All in Georgia and North Carolina, not crazy flips, but extremely odd how it happens in these swing states. Also, if Trump is looking for foul play in PA, I don’t think it’s in Philadelphia(maybe some). But the only county in the entire state to have a lower percentage of Trump votes than percentage of registered Republicans is Delaware county. I live there and there is no way Trump did not get a large showing of voters for him on Election Day. There were lines at almost every polling place all day. If you compare this county and other Philly suburbs to any other non-swing-state suburb county, it’s is extremely out of place and irregular.

DerangedDeceiver;trump;"You know what? I'm in a good mood today. I'll bite.

----------

The archetypical example of unprotected speech is ""Yelling 'FIRE!' in a crowded theater"". This speech is unprotected because it is *disinformation that may directly lead to other people taking action that causes people to be injured or even killed*. The person shouting ""FIRE!"" may be doing nothing more than speaking, they may not be participating in the ensuing evacuation, they may not even be lying (it may be that they honestly believe that the theater is on fire). However, due to the harmful effect their words may have on others, this speech is prohibited.

Now let's go over a simple example of how this kind of speech may show up in another form.

Lets posit a person who says, ""The reptilians have secretly taken over the US Postal Service and they are going to attack the country with chemical weapons if we don't stop them"". Now, we live in a time where any nutjob can upload their delusional conspiracy rant onto youtube and gain a following of people who sincerely believe them. It's a very real possibility that their words may inspire one of their viewers to attack the ""reptilians in disguise"" at the post office. That means that this statement is *disinformation that may directly lead to other people taking action that causes people to be injured or even killed*. I ask you: Does this example differ fundamentally from the former? Is this not another scenario where the best option is to stop the spread of this misinformation before someone gets injured or killed because of it?

Finally, lets go over a direct example. A statement in the same form as the previous example, but that isn't something silly I made up.

Lets posit a person who says, ""The muslims are invading America and trying to take over the government so they can force us to follow Sharia law"". This is a sentiment expressed so often, by so many people, that I wouldn't be surprised at all if somebody has actually said the exact words I just typed. It is a sentiment that has, factually, led to individuals taking what they are convinced is necessary action. Although it did not happen in America, the Christchurch shooting is an example that immediately comes to mind of someone being so convinced by the rhetoric of Muslims having some nefarious goal in practicing their religion and/or immigrating to the west that they commit a brutal act of mass murder against innocent people. This is, once again, *disinformation that may directly lead to other people taking action that causes people to be injured or even killed*. As such, I'll ask once more: Does this example differ fundamentally from the others? Is this not another scenario where the best option is to stop the spread of this misinformation before *more people* get injured or killed because of it?

----------

In all honesty, I don't believe I'll convince anybody with this, but I hope that, at the very least, it gives some of you a better idea of how some people come to disagree with you on the subject of silencing certain statements. 

Additionally, just a note, we all know that political discussion can get *exhausting*, so please understand that I may not reply to replies on this comment. I'm just not always up to it.

flexican_american;trump;"Leftist Agree! :D We do have a homeless problem! Let's tax the billionaires of Silicon Valley and their high ranking employees that want to gentrify our ""trendy"" urban neighborhoods we've been living in for generations. Let's reduce taxes on the working class and audit agencies to cut overhead. Also let's cut military spending because blowing up civilians just creates resent for our country and it's a waste of our tax money. These straw man arguments that the true left loves high income taxes on the working class is an argument in bad faith. The platform is: workers should own the means of production. The conservative welders and steel workers of my apartment building live in two bedroom units with 3 kids give or take. They should be able to afford a home for their family as they have made millions for their respective companies. Their labor is worth more than the money reflected on their paychecks. Same thing goes for retail workers. America is the people not a flag. The homeless people of california are in large part victims of the opioid epidemic.

NotDrewBrees;biden;"If there's anything that's permanently repelled me from voting for TX GOP candidates in the future, it's: 

* Allen West taking over the state party. 

* Greg Abbott pandering to the far right and enforcing voter suppression methods

* Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers growing their influence within the party decision makers

* Shelley 'UberKaren' Luther running for a State Senate seat only because she reopened her nail salon and got arrested for breaking the law

* Colloidal silver hawker Steve Hotze demanding that all rioters and protestors be shot and killed on sight

* Attorney General Ken Paxton finally being exposed for the fraudster piece of shit we always knew he is

* Lt. Governor Dan Patrick existing

* Ag Commissioner Sid Miller flying to Oklahoma on taxpayer funds to get a 'Jesus shot' 

* Every single GOP congressman, state house rep and state senator denying the climate change and stuffing every regulatory post with bureaucratic dismantlers

* Baptist churches hawking Christian Dominionist theory and pushing their Deacons and biggest tithers to run for office and literally instill a God King

* Ignoring the very principles that Republicans once stood for - limited government, low taxation, free trade and balanced budgets

* Mismanaging a COVID-19 pandemic so badly that the oil & gas industry (which I work in) is in complete tatters. Trump & Abbott ironically instilled a more effective fracking ban than anyone could ever hope for. Nice job looking out for the industry you supposedly support, dipshits (Biden helped lift the crude export ban in a - dare I say it - compromise, which was a huge boon for our industry and helped push Saudi Arabian crude oil back to their shores in lieu of American crude)

**EDIT: Since this shot up, I'll take the time to implore you to volunteer because a few 100 more voters in the 6 key swing states is 0.01% of the margin which is recorded in history books, and is an amazing effort of helping prevent 4 more years of Trump.**

* [For a very in depth breakdown of the status of each swing state, please see a thread I made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/ic4xgq/a_very_detailed_review_of_each_swing_state_with/)  I'll link the images from it here for the lazy.

He-is;biden;"Some people asked me about what made me change my mind about Trump so here it is. I care a lot about the troops and the foreign policy and Trump failed both. 

First [he withdrew from northern Syria ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-betrayed-us-fleeing-kurds-condemn-u-s-decision-to-leave-syria)and let Turkey invade and bomb the Kurds. 

Then COVID hit and Trump sent the national guard to help fight covid which is good. BUT [he called off the troops on the 89th day](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/05/20/early-end-date-for-guard-coronavirus-deployment-draws-criticism-from-veterans-in-congress/) of their deployment which would be one day before they would start getting retirement and education benefits. 

Shortly after that, the protests started and Trump called on the governors to call in the national guards and “dominate the streets.” 

Then there were reports that Russia put bounties on our troops and Trump knew about this for months and did nothing.

And most recently there were reports that [Trump called our troops “losers.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-said-us-soldiers-injured-and-killed-in-war-were-losers-magazine-reports/2020/09/03/6e1725cc-ee35-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html)

I came here to get an education and never left. I came to the US in 2007 and right after Obama, things felt so much better.
In the US, I found a place to where I belonged. Growing up in India, I never had that feeling.

Trump came in 2016 and I lived on edge ever since. 

Everytime I went back to see my mom, I will be worried about going through the visa interview process. Granted DHS were never too welcoming, but I didn't feel a sense of hostility from them, until 2016. I made a point to enter the US either from NYC or SFO, as I might get agents who have lived amongst brown people and might be a little more human towards us.

Blarglephish;biden;"Ive been checking 538 near daily, and while I am ecstatic to see this - along with the new A+ rated WI poll showing Biden up +17 - Trump still has an 11 point chance, which is higher than I would like. I am most concerned about Pennsylvania, as I think this is going to be the deciding state. Biden is up by \~5 points, but that is still within standard margin of error (3.5 for each candidate, so a 7 point swing).

AnswerIsItDepends;biden;"Thank you.

I have a question though.  This relates to the famous quote ""what is in a name?""  from Shakespeare.  Why would you say you will always be a Republican?  I am assuming you chose to be Republican at some point for reasons.  What if the current Republicans did not match those reasons at all?

Don't get me wrong, I ***really*** hope the true, honest conservatives can reclaim the party.  I really do.  But I do not know enough about politics to give you odds on that.  What if they can't?  What if dishonest people steal the name ""Republican""?   I ask because, while I don't know the odds, I can't help but think the odds might be better if they knew they could lose support.

Full disclosure:  From 1987 to 2016 I was unaffiliated voter so party loyalty isn't natural for me.  So perhaps that is what I am struggling to understand.";"[""Am I the Asshole?

Celsissima;trump;"“In Fairfax County, an early-morning math error led to over-reporting Biden’s lead by roughly 100,000 votes — a mistake that Stephen M. Hunt, chairman of the Fairfax County electoral board, said was discovered and corrected within 10 to 15 minutes.

Hunt said approximately two-thirds of Fairfax County’s vote came through early absentee voting. An election worker initially erroneously added 100,000 to Biden’s absentee ballot count when adding up all the sources of absentee ballots in the county: by mail, through a dropbox, in person. The correct vote totals in Fairfax County as of 2:30 a.m. Wednesday showed Biden with roughly 404,000 votes to Trump’s roughly 162,000.”

jayembeisme;trump;"Do we have proof?  YES!  Just look at the wealth of information from the owner of the store where Biden dropped off the laptops to get them fixed!!

1) WHERE DID IT COME FROM? “the owner of the computer store, John Paul MacIsaac, was unable and unwilling to answer key questions about how the laptop supposedly arrived in his store, and eventually, how the data was shared with Giuliani”

2) DID HUNTER DROP THEM OFF HIMSELF? “MacIsaac admitted he was unable to confirm it was actually Hunter Biden who dropped off the laptop because he is ""legally blind""”

3) DID THE OWNER SECURE THE SENSITIVE CONTENTS? “MacIsaac refused to answer in any detail whether or why he would have searched through the laptop to find a four-year-old email, which seemingly appears to be an innocuous message about arranging a meeting for coffee.”

4) WHY ARE THE LIBS SCREAMIN’ ‘BOUT RUDY G? “MacIsaac responded to most questions about Giuliani with ""no comment,"" saying he ""didn't feel comfortable"" discussing it. He declined to say whether he sought Giuliani out or vice versa, but he indicated he viewed the former New York mayor as a potential ally.”

5) THANK GOD THE OWNER IS OF SOUND MIND AND BODY AND NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORIST. “Over the course of the interview, MacIsaac said he felt his life and business were in danger by possessing this information, invoking debunked conspiracy theories of revenge, specifically mentioning false allegations that a Democratic National Committee staffer was murdered in 2016 to cover up his supposed involvement in leaking Democratic Party emails. The emails were in fact stolen by Russian intelligence operatives, and the conspiracy theory surrounding his death was boosted by a Russian disinformation campaign.”

In California, for prison labor, none of the stuff prisoners produce can be sold, they are used for the public sector, for instance, prisoners who make desks make the desks that ends up in schools, government office buildings and police departments.

LordSThor;biden;"First off if you haven't voted already, go FUCKING VOTE

Second off

This makes me happy :)

FYI the numbers are likely to improve over the next few days. 538 expected the polls to tighten as we approached election day, they have slightly (by like half a point) but Biden is still roughly ahead by 9 points, and ahead in pretty much every single swing state often times he's ahead by 5 points or more.

In fact if we had the election today and Biden only won states which he had a 5 point or greater lead he'd still have 290 EC Votes.

Trump needs about 7 or 8 point swing to win

That's not happening.

Basically everything we see indicates Trump is going lose in a landslide.";"[""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Reddit Sports"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""World News"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Relationship Advice"", ""Reddit Sports"", ""Politics"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""PC Gaming"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Politics"", ""best of reddit"", ""Politics"", ""World News"", ""Politics"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""Politics"", ""Pro Revenge"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Ask Reddit..."", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""/r/PublicFreakout"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Korea: Life, News, and Identity"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Politics"", ""Georgia, USA"", ""NFL: National Football League Discussion"", ""/r/buildapc - Planning on building a computer but need some advice?
