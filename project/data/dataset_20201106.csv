SloppySutter;Donald Trump - 45th President of the United States of America;What I have found is that all my friends that are on the left have full-out convinced themselves that the reason they don‚Äôt have what other people have is because ‚Äúthe system is rigged against them‚Äù. It blows my mind why people can‚Äôt look at an orphan like Steve Jobs or a billionaire like Bill Gates (who came from nothing), and make the observation that those men PROSPERED in our society of capitalism and low regulation! Perhaps it‚Äôs a lack of parenting, or perhaps a lack of interest in logical reasoning, but these people honestly believe that by having the government regulate absolutely everything that they‚Äôll be ‚Äúmore free‚Äù and have more money and things at their disposal?! I just find that ludicrous. The government is terrible at everything they try to orchestrate. As soon as they touch something, it gets over-staffed, starves for an endless supply of tax money, and becomes mindlessly bureaucratic. Is that what they want in their hospitals? In their workplaces? I have to believe this is all a lack of education on how government works in schools. I really think half these people don‚Äôt understand that Congress makes laws... not the president! I‚Äôm with all of you folks.

SirMartty;Donald Trump - 45th President of the United States of America;Good to see that we can be all civil at the end of the day, usually we see the negativity on the news and people on both sides think that the other side is out to get them, I don‚Äôt believe that all Liberals are annoying SJWs, but the louder few are certainly being supported by the higher up Democrats, making them louder. Negativity can bring a country to it‚Äôs knees, let‚Äôs not surround ourselves with negativity, let‚Äôs all be tolerant about each-others ideas and bring them to the table, we should constantly be improving America for all, Conservatives and Liberals at the same time.;['Donald Trump - 45th President of the United States of America', 'Ask Reddit...', 'SomeOrdinaryGamers', 'PornhubComments: Showcasing the wit of Pornhub commenters.', 'Everything about Tinder', 'Maybe a true hot mess?'];

It‚Äôs very complex for me. I dont even necessarily love Trump. The man himself is a bit... i dunno. To me.

He gets demonized so badly and meanwhile i‚Äôm watching from the sidelines of europe thinking ‚Äúuhm okay he may not be my favorite person in the world but you dont gotta treat him like that. Sone things he says make a lot if sense‚Äù

He-is;Joe Biden for President;"Some people asked me about what made me change my mind about Trump so here it is. I care a lot about the troops and the foreign policy and Trump failed both. 

First [he withdrew from northern Syria ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-betrayed-us-fleeing-kurds-condemn-u-s-decision-to-leave-syria)and let Turkey invade and bomb the Kurds. 

Then COVID hit and Trump sent the national guard to help fight covid which is good. BUT [he called off the troops on the 89th day](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/05/20/early-end-date-for-guard-coronavirus-deployment-draws-criticism-from-veterans-in-congress/) of their deployment which would be one day before they would start getting retirement and education benefits. 

Shortly after that, the protests started and Trump called on the governors to call in the national guards and ‚Äúdominate the streets.‚Äù 

Then there were reports that Russia put bounties on our troops and Trump knew about this for months and did nothing.

And most recently there were reports that [Trump called our troops ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-said-us-soldiers-injured-and-killed-in-war-were-losers-magazine-reports/2020/09/03/6e1725cc-ee35-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html)
