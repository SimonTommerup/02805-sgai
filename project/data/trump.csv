SloppySutter,Donald Trump - 45th President of the United States of America,"What I have found is that all my friends that are on the left have full-out convinced themselves that the reason they don’t have what other people have is because “the system is rigged against them”. It blows my mind why people can’t look at an orphan like Steve Jobs or a billionaire like Bill Gates (who came from nothing), and make the observation that those men PROSPERED in our society of capitalism and low regulation! Perhaps it’s a lack of parenting, or perhaps a lack of interest in logical reasoning, but these people honestly believe that by having the government regulate absolutely everything that they’ll be “more free” and have more money and things at their disposal?! I just find that ludicrous. The government is terrible at everything they try to orchestrate. As soon as they touch something, it gets over-staffed, starves for an endless supply of tax money, and becomes mindlessly bureaucratic. Is that what they want in their hospitals? In their workplaces?
